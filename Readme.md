# Unnaned Project
This project is majorly based off of the [Hazel Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) built and maintained by [@TheCherno](https://github.com/TheCherno/)

## Goal of this project
To learn enough about building game engines to build up a engine with students at WTC_ to further spearhead many more projects in different language based engines

## Solving?
We have many students who are interested in game development, wether it be engine, or game developement itself.
My hope is for this to help students get involved in the open source commuinty [@WeThinkCode_](https://www.wethinkcode.co.za/)
